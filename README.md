# Face-and-eye-detection

The "Face & Eyes Recognition in OpenCV" project typically involves using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library, to develop a system that can detect and recognize faces and eyes in images. OpenCV provides pre-trained models and functions for facial and eye recognition, making it a convenient choice for such projects.

A brief overview of the project's main components:
-Image Input: The project begins by capturing input from images.
-Face Detection: OpenCV provides pre-trained Haar cascades for face detection. These cascades are essentially classifiers trained to recognize patterns associated with faces. The system uses these cascades to identify faces in the input images or video frames.
-Eye Detection: Similar to face detection, OpenCV also provides Haar cascades for eye detection. After identifying faces, the system further processes these regions to locate eyes within the detected faces.
-Visualization: To demonstrate the recognition process, the project often includes visualizations such as bounding boxes around detected faces and eyes.
